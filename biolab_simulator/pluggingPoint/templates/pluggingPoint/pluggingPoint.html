        <h1>Plugging Point</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The plugging point corresponds to the temperature of an oil fraction at which crystal formation occurs, in
            quantity such that a pressure drop occurs in a standardized filter, causing the product to cease to flow
            (FARAH, 2015). Although in the definition used, the plugging point is specified for oil fractions, the concept
            also applies to biodiesel and is referred to as Cold Filter Plugging Point (CFPP).</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The plugging point, as well as the other properties, is strongly influenced by the chain length of the
            ester. While, unlike the previous ones, there are authors who claim that the presence of unsaturation does not present
            influence on this property, arguing that the CFPP of biodiesels is related to the length factor of saturated chain (LCSF).</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Many studies have been carried out to determine how the structure of the fuel's component molecules affects
            its cetane number and it is known that the longer the carbon chain (the greater the number of carbons in the molecule),
            the higher its cetane number. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of unsaturation in the chain makes the
            cetane number of the compound to be reduced.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Based on the idea of ​​this factor, one model type that was developed to predict this property takes into account
            considering the composition of the mixture (RAMOS, FERNÁNDEZ, et al., 2009), assuming that unsaturated compounds
            behave as solvents for saturated compounds, since the melting temperature of unsaturated compounds is
            considerably smaller than that of saturated ones. With this said, the crystals formed responsible for the pressure drop 
            quoted are from the saturated esters.</p>
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, there are models that also consider the influence of unsaturated compounds in the determination of this
            property from the composition of the mixture (SU, Yung-Chieh, et al., 2009), stating that the presence of these compounds,
            even if they have lower plugging points than the saturated ones, they contribute to the reduction of the mixture's CFPP.
            Defending that double bonds cause a reduction of attractive forces between molecules, engendering a reduction in the CFPP.</p>  
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because of the problems generated by high CFPP values, it is extremely important to keep in mind the 
            climatic conditions of the region for which the fuel is intended to be sold for at each period of the year, with the main highlight being
            for regions where the climate reaches lower temperatures, such as the southern region of Brazil to avoid problems of phase
            change in biodiesel. The CFFP values in Brazil ​​are specified on the ANP website for each state and the respective
            month of the year, taking into account the weather for that time of year.</p>
